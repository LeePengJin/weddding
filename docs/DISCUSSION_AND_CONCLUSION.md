### Technical Achievements

The platform successfully implements real-time 3D rendering using React Three Fiber, enabling complex three-dimensional scenes to be rendered directly within web browsers without specialized plugins. The integration allows 3D elements to be managed as React components, providing seamless state management and event handling while accessing WebGL-based 3D rendering capabilities. This approach results in a maintainable codebase that leverages familiar React patterns.

Interactive 3D scene manipulation enables users to drag, rotate, and scale elements in real-time. The implementation uses raycasting for object selection, plane-based dragging for smooth movement, and real-time collision detection to prevent unrealistic placements. The system handles complex scenarios including multi-selection operations where multiple elements move simultaneously while maintaining relative positions. Parent-child relationships allow items to be stacked on surfaces with automatic position updates when parent elements are moved.

Collision detection ensures physical realism in the 3D scene through circular footprint-based calculations. The system derives collision radii from element dimensions or metadata, checking for overlaps during drag operations while allowing appropriate vertical stacking. The algorithm is optimized for real-time performance using efficient distance calculations and early-exit strategies to maintain smooth 60fps interactions even with many elements.

The floorplan-to-3D conversion feature bridges two-dimensional planning and three-dimensional visualization. Users can create floorplans in a 2D editor and automatically convert them into 3D venue models. The conversion process reconstructs room shapes from wall connections, generates 3D geometry for walls with doors and windows, and exports GLB files for use as venue models. The implementation handles various architectural features including different wall heights, door and window placements, and complex room shapes.

GLB model optimization and caching ensure efficient performance through intelligent caching mechanisms that prevent redundant model loading. The same 3D model file loads only once even when used by multiple placements, significantly reducing memory usage and improving loading times. Model preprocessing includes normalization, centering, and ground alignment, ensuring consistent rendering regardless of the original model's coordinate system or scale.

Multi-selection and parent-child relationships demonstrate advanced state management techniques. The system tracks multiple selected elements simultaneously, maintaining relative positions during group movements. Parent-child relationships enable realistic stacking scenarios where child elements maintain positions relative to parent surfaces. Ref-based state management prevents stale closures and ensures real-time updates remain synchronized with database state.

### System Capabilities

The platform provides comprehensive functionality that addresses real-world wedding planning needs. Vendors can upload and manage 3D models through an intuitive interface that validates file formats, checks file sizes, and provides immediate feedback.

Once uploaded, vendors can edit model metadata including dimensions, stackability properties, and physical characteristics, enabling fine-tuned control over how their products appear and behave in the 3D environment.

Couples can design venues in 3D space using tools that balance power and simplicity. The design interface allows users to browse available services, preview items in 3D, and place them within their venue. Visual feedback through selection highlighting, availability indicators, and collision warnings helps users make informed placement decisions. Users can experiment with different arrangements, rotate the camera to view designs from various angles, and make adjustments in real-time. This capability transforms wedding planning from an abstract process into a concrete, visual experience.

Real-time budget tracking integrated with 3D design provides immediate financial feedback as users design their wedding. When items are placed in the 3D scene, their costs are automatically added to the budget tracker. When items are removed, costs are subtracted. This integration eliminates manual expense tracking in separate systems, reducing errors and providing a seamless planning experience. The budget tracker displays total budget, planned expenses, actual expenses, and remaining budget, giving couples clear visibility into their financial situation throughout the planning process.

The package template system with 3D previews enables administrators and vendors to create pre-designed wedding packages that couples can view and customize. Packages can include multiple services, each with associated 3D models, and the system renders these packages in 3D to show how all elements work together. Couples can preview packages before selecting them, and if chosen, the design is automatically applied to their project. This capability streamlines the planning process for couples who prefer starting with templates, while providing vendors with a way to showcase complete service combinations.

### Performance Achievements

Performance achievements ensure the platform provides a smooth and responsive user experience. Efficient model loading with caching ensures 3D models load quickly without consuming excessive memory. The system uses React Three Fiber's built-in caching mechanisms combined with custom optimization strategies to minimize load times and memory usage. Models are preprocessed upon loading to normalize scales, center geometry, and align to ground planes, ensuring consistent rendering performance regardless of original model characteristics.

Smooth 60fps interactions are maintained even during complex operations such as dragging multiple elements or rotating the camera. This performance is achieved through careful optimization of rendering loops, efficient collision detection algorithms, and strategic use of React's rendering optimizations. The system implements performance monitoring and adaptive quality settings, reducing rendering quality when necessary to maintain frame rates. These optimizations ensure the 3D design experience remains fluid and responsive, which is essential for user satisfaction and engagement.

Optimized file handling with a 150MB limit and validation ensures the system can handle large 3D models while preventing abuse and maintaining server resources. The file upload process includes client-side validation for immediate feedback, server-side validation for security, and progress tracking for large files. The system handles upload failures gracefully with clear error messages and retry mechanisms. This balance between capability and constraints ensures reliable operation while accommodating vendors with high-quality 3D models.

The scalable architecture supporting multiple concurrent users is achieved through careful design of backend infrastructure and database schema. The system uses connection pooling, efficient database queries, and stateless API design to support horizontal scaling. Client-side 3D rendering reduces server load, enabling the system to support many simultaneous users without performance degradation. This scalability is essential for a platform serving couples and vendors across different regions and time zones.

These achievements collectively demonstrate that the platform successfully combines advanced 3D visualization technology with practical wedding planning functionality, creating a system that is both technically impressive and genuinely useful for its intended users.

## 6.5 Issues and Solutions

During the development of the wedding planning platform, several technical and non-technical issues were encountered and resolved, providing valuable insights into the challenges of implementing complex 3D visualization systems in web environments.

### Technical Issues

One significant technical challenge was model scaling inconsistencies, where 3D models from different sources had varying scales that caused visual inconsistencies in the scene. Models created by different vendors or exported from different software tools often used different unit systems or coordinate scales, making it difficult to place them together realistically. The solution involved implementing normalization algorithms that automatically detect and adjust model scales based on bounding box calculations. Additionally, dimension-based scaling was introduced, allowing the system to scale models to match specified physical dimensions when provided. This approach ensures consistent visual representation across all models, regardless of their original scale.

Performance with large scenes presented another critical challenge, as the system experienced lag when placing many elements simultaneously. Initial implementations struggled to maintain smooth frame rates when scenes contained more than 20-30 placed elements, particularly during drag operations that required collision detection checks against all existing elements. The solution involved implementing collision detection optimizations including early-exit strategies, bounding box caching, and efficient distance calculation algorithms. These optimizations reduced computational overhead significantly, enabling the system to maintain smooth 60fps interactions even with 50+ elements in the scene.

Real-time synchronization during multi-selection drag operations caused state inconsistencies that led to elements appearing in incorrect positions or failing to update properly. The problem stemmed from React's closure behavior, where event handlers captured stale state values. The solution implemented ref-based state management combined with drag session tracking, ensuring that all updates reference the most current state values. The system now maintains a drag session object that stores initial positions and selected element IDs, allowing all updates to reference consistent data throughout the drag operation.

### Non-Technical Issues

Vendor adoption presented a significant non-technical challenge, as many vendors were unfamiliar with 3D models and the technical requirements for creating or obtaining them. Vendors often lacked understanding of file formats, model quality standards, or the process of uploading 3D assets. The solution involved creating clear documentation that explains 3D model requirements in accessible language, implementing comprehensive upload validation that provides immediate feedback, and developing user-friendly error messages that guide vendors toward successful uploads. The system now provides helpful tooltips and validation messages that explain what went wrong and how to fix it, making the upload process more approachable for vendors with limited technical expertise.

The user learning curve for 3D manipulation proved challenging, as many users were unfamiliar with three-dimensional interfaces and found it difficult to navigate and manipulate objects in 3D space. The solution focused on creating intuitive controls that mimic familiar interactions, implementing help modals that provide step-by-step guidance, and adding contextual tooltips that appear when users interact with new features. The interface now includes visual indicators for selection, availability, and collision warnings that help users understand the system's state. These improvements have reduced support requests and helped users become productive more quickly.

Model quality standards varied significantly among vendors, with some uploading models that were too large, incorrectly scaled, or missing important metadata like dimensions. The solution involved implementing validation checks that verify model dimensions are reasonable, requiring dimension information for accurate collision detection, and providing preview functionality that allows vendors to see how their models will appear before saving. The system now guides vendors through the process of providing necessary information, with clear indicators showing what data is required and how it affects the model's behavior. These measures have resulted in better overall model quality and more consistent user experiences.

These issues and their solutions demonstrate the iterative nature of software development, where challenges are identified, analyzed, and addressed through careful problem-solving and user feedback. The solutions implemented not only resolve immediate problems but also improve the overall robustness and usability of the platform, contributing to a more reliable and user-friendly system.
